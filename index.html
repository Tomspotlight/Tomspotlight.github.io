        <p>Spotlight Health is a Newcastle-upon-Tyne based health tech company founded in 2023, dedicated to developing groundbreaking 
          AI-powered technology for diagnosing endometriosis using data and scan images. Our mission is to reduce time to diagnosis and 
          increase accessibility to high quality diagnostics, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes for  women.</p>

        <p>1 in 10 Women of those assigned female at birth suffer from endometriosis while of reproductive age.<label for="sn-in-his-later-books" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-in-his-later-books" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19196878/"><em>Priorities for endometriosis research: recommendations from an international consensus workshop. Rogers et al.</em></a></span>
        <p>On average it takes 8 Years from onset of symptoms to diagnosis.<label for="sn-in-his-later-book" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-in-his-later-book" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><em>World Health Organization, 2018; Zondervan et al., 2020</em></a></span>

         
<p>During this time endometriosis sufferers often endure:</p>
<ul><li>Severe pelvic pain</li>
<li>Difficulty conceiving</li>
<li>Nausea and gastric symptoms, especially during periods</li>
<li>Decline in mental wellbeing resulting in anxiety and depression</li></ul>
<p>This often results in a huge impact on a sufferer's quality of life.</p>
<p>The current gold standard diagnostic is an invasive surgical procedure.</p>
<p>What if we could leverage the power of data and machine learning to both speed up diagnosis, perform the diagnosis non-invasively, and increase accessibility.</p>
<p>This has the potential to both reduce the burden to healthcare systems and improve patient outcomes.</p>
