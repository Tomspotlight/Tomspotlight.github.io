        <p>Spotlight Health is a Bio-tech company dedicated to developing diagnostics tools by combining biology, engineering and data science</p>

        <p><span class="newthought">1 in 10 Women </span> and those assigned female at birth suffer from endometriosis while of reproductive age.<label for="sn-in-his-later-books" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-in-his-later-books" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19196878/"><em>Priorities for endometriosis research: recommendations from an international consensus workshop. Rogers et al.</em></a></span>
        <p>On average it takes 8 Years from onset of symptoms to diagnosis.<label for="sn-in-his-later-book" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-in-his-later-book" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"><em>World Health Organization, 2018; Zondervan et al., 2020</em></a></span>

         
<p>During this time endometriosis sufferers often endure:</p>
<ul><li>Severe pelvic pain</li>
<li>Difficulty conceiving</li>
<li>Nausea and gastric symptoms, especially during period</li>
<li>Decline in mental wellbeing resulting in anxiety and depression</li></ul>
<p>This often results in a huge impact on a sufferer's quality of life.</p>
<p>What if we could leverage the power of data and machine learning to both speed up diagnosis but also increase accessibility to diagnosis.</p>
<p>This has the potential to both reduce the burden to healthcare systems and improve patient outcomes.</p>
