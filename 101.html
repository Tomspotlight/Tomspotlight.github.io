<h2>Endometriosis101.</h2>

        <h3>What?</h3>
        <p>Endometriosis is a condition where endometrial tissue, which normally forms the womb lining, grows outside of the uterus. This tissue responds to hormonal fluctuations in the same way that tissue lining the womb would, resulting in cyclical inflammation and pain.</p>  

         <h3>Where?</h3>
        <p>This endometrial-like tissue is most commonly found around the pelvic organs, though endometriosis has been found in other areas o the body including the chest and even the brain. Endometriosis can cause ovarian cysts, superficial lesions, deeper nodules, adhesions (tissue that connects your organs and binds them together) and scar tissue which can result in chronic symptoms. </p>  

        
         <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>The cause of endometriosis is not known, though some risk factors including a family history of the condition are understood. </p>  

         <h3>How?</h3>
        <p>In a minority of cases it is possible to identify endometriosis during an abdominal ultrasound scan, however, current gold-standard diagnostic procedure to confirm presence of endometriosis is exploratory surgery. This diagnostic procedure while being uncomfortable for the patient, carries significant risk and is expensive.</p>
